This is a prototype of a software intended to query data inside ExpertSender Vtex Data Tables (database tables), facilitating consulting information like payment system type, order status, order date, client email address, client's firstname and phone, order date, etc., queries and results through a web application.

Here we have a Java web application built with Servlet and Java Server Pages (scriptlets and JSTL) technologies, JDBC with MySql, HttpClient for Rest API, BootStrap (HTML &  CSS), JavaScript and Ajax.

Making API calls in Java was initially amazing for me. However, here I had the chance to do it with vanilla JavaScript and Ajax (XMLHttpRequest), passing server side parameters from Java to JavaScript, using them in the front-end, and seeing this at work was beyond fabulous to me.

This prototype was a great achievement for me, though without recognition as I expected. I decided to leave it on Github untouched, with comments here and there, so that I could always check my intentions that I left behind in the future.

Proud to be bringing this to Github and giving it little visibility.
