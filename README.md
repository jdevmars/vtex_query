This is a prototype of a software intended to query data inside ExpertSender Vtex Data Tables (database tables), facilitating consulting information like payment system type, order status, order date, client email address, client's firstname and phone, order date, etc., queries and results through a web application.

When I said prototype, that's because my intention was to demonstrate this to my boss and colleague, and hopefully they'd suggest something for the future like tweaking the application to produce a product for selling to our clients, or who knows, this prototype would give them any ideas on what different I could create with the demonstrated background present in this software. Well, in the end, the most I obtained was "awesome!", and that's all, I was told our clients are not keen to search for their information outside the ExpertSender platform itself, even if I provided a more user friendly interface... Not even assessment of my knowledge for a new future software, that was quite said to me, truly... They don't know the tremendous effort I put on this as a novice... It's my first web application, my object was to make something serious, and there a lot of technologies in here.

Here we have a Java web application built with Servlet and Java Server Pages (scriptlets and JSTL) technologies, JDBC with MySql, HttpClient for Rest API, BootStrap (HTML &  CSS), JavaScript and Ajax.

Making API calls in Java was initially amazing for me. However, here I had the chance to do it with vanilla JavaScript and Ajax (XMLHttpRequest), passing server side parameters from Java to JavaScript, using them in the front-end, and seeing this at work was beyond fabulous to me.

This prototype was a great achievement for me, though without recognition as I expected. I decided to leave it on Github untouched, with comments here and there, so that I could always check my intentions that I left behind in the future.

Proud to be bringing this to Github and giving it little visibility.
